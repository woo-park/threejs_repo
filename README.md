    For this final project, I want to create 4 different spaces on the web. 
    I plan to create a space for each drawing because I believe that the web is no longer just a flat surface.
    The first drawing will be a place that is filled with intense energy. 
    I want it to be vibrant, dynamic, disorganized, and almost aggressive.

    The second drawing will be a place that is very organized, meticulous, serene, and even dark. 
    This space will probably portray the direct opposite state of feeling from the first drawing. 
    It will have a lot of repeated objects, but nothing distinct and outstanding. 
    Currently, I am thinking of dark clouds, raining and toned-down blue color scheme throughout the drawing.

    The third drawing will represent a place that I recently discovered. 
    It is somewhere that I often go to and get completely lost. 
    This place is almost in-between the first drawing and the second drawing. 
    It will generate a feeling that one is alone, standing near the ocean, and even floating underwater.

    Lastly, the last drawing will have three links. Each link will lead to three drawings described above. 
    The links will rotate in a circular motion as a collective group.
    
    Each drawing is part of who I am. However, my goal here is to generate three different spaces that evoke three distinctive feelings.
